## V13.1 — Configuration Documentation

- **v5.0.0-13.1.1** (L2) Verify that all communication needs for the application
  are documented. This must include external services which the application
  relies upon and cases where an end user might be able to provide an external
  location to which the application will then connect.
- **v5.0.0-13.1.2** (L3) Verify that for each service the application uses, the
  documentation defines the maximum number of concurrent connections (e.g.,
  connection pool limits) and how the application behaves when that limit is
  reached, including any fallback or recovery mechanisms, to prevent denial of
  service conditions.
- **v5.0.0-13.1.3** (L3) Verify that the application documentation defines
  resource‑management strategies for every external system or service it uses
  (e.g., databases, file handles, threads, HTTP connections). This should
  include resource‑release procedures, timeout settings, failure handling, and
  where retry logic is implemented, specifying retry limits, delays, and
  back‑off algorithms. For synchronous HTTP request–response operations it
  should mandate short timeouts and either disable retries or strictly limit
  retries to prevent cascading delays and resource exhaustion.
- **v5.0.0-13.1.4** (L3) Verify that the application's documentation defines the
  secrets that are critical for the security of the application and a schedule
  for rotating them, based on the organization's threat model and business
  requirements.

## V13.2 — Backend Communication Configuration

- **v5.0.0-13.2.1** (L2) Verify that communications between backend application
  components that don't support the application's standard user session
  mechanism, including APIs, middleware, and data layers, are authenticated.
  Authentication must use individual service accounts, short-term tokens, or
  certificate-based authentication and not unchanging credentials such as
  passwords, API keys, or shared accounts with privileged access.
- **v5.0.0-13.2.2** (L2) Verify that communications between backend application
  components, including local or operating system services, APIs, middleware,
  and data layers, are performed with accounts assigned the least necessary
  privileges.
- **v5.0.0-13.2.3** (L2) Verify that if a credential has to be used for service
  authentication, the credential being used by the consumer is not a default
  credential (e.g., root/root or admin/admin).
- **v5.0.0-13.2.4** (L2) Verify that an allowlist is used to define the external
  resources or systems with which the application is permitted to communicate
  (e.g., for outbound requests, data loads, or file access). This allowlist can
  be implemented at the application layer, web server, firewall, or a
  combination of different layers.
- **v5.0.0-13.2.5** (L2) Verify that the web or application server is configured
  with an allowlist of resources or systems to which the server can send
  requests or load data or files from.
- **v5.0.0-13.2.6** (L3) Verify that where the application connects to separate
  services, it follows the documented configuration for each connection, such as
  maximum parallel connections, behavior when maximum allowed connections is
  reached, connection timeouts, and retry strategies.

## V13.3 — Secret Management

- **v5.0.0-13.3.1** (L2) Verify that a secrets management solution, such as a
  key vault, is used to securely create, store, control access to, and destroy
  backend secrets. These could include passwords, key material, integrations
  with databases and third-party systems, keys and seeds for time-based tokens,
  other internal secrets, and API keys. Secrets must not be included in
  application source code or included in build artifacts. For an L3 application,
  this must involve a hardware-backed solution such as an HSM.
- **v5.0.0-13.3.2** (L2) Verify that access to secret assets adheres to the
  principle of least privilege.
- **v5.0.0-13.3.3** (L3) Verify that all cryptographic operations are performed
  using an isolated security module (such as a vault or hardware security
  module) to securely manage and protect key material from exposure outside of
  the security module.
- **v5.0.0-13.3.4** (L3) Verify that secrets are configured to expire and be
  rotated based on the application's documentation.

## V13.4 — Unintended Information Leakage

- **v5.0.0-13.4.1** (L1) Verify that the application is deployed either without
  any source control metadata, including the .git or .svn folders, or in a way
  that these folders are inaccessible both externally and to the application
  itself.
- **v5.0.0-13.4.2** (L2) Verify that debug modes are disabled for all components
  in production environments to prevent exposure of debugging features and
  information leakage.
- **v5.0.0-13.4.3** (L2) Verify that web servers do not expose directory
  listings to clients unless explicitly intended.
- **v5.0.0-13.4.4** (L2) Verify that using the HTTP TRACE method is not
  supported in production environments, to avoid potential information leakage.
- **v5.0.0-13.4.5** (L2) Verify that documentation (such as for internal APIs)
  and monitoring endpoints are not exposed unless explicitly intended.
- **v5.0.0-13.4.6** (L3) Verify that the application does not expose detailed
  version information of backend components.
- **v5.0.0-13.4.7** (L3) Verify that the web tier is configured to only serve
  files with specific file extensions to prevent unintentional information,
  configuration, and source code leakage.
