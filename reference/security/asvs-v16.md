## V16.1 — Security Logging Documentation

- **v5.0.0-16.1.1** (L2) Verify that an inventory exists documenting the logging
  performed at each layer of the application's technology stack, what events are
  being logged, log formats, where that logging is stored, how it is used, how
  access to it is controlled, and for how long logs are kept.

## V16.2 — General Logging

- **v5.0.0-16.2.1** (L2) Verify that each log entry includes necessary metadata
  (such as when, where, who, what) that would allow for a detailed investigation
  of the timeline when an event happens.
- **v5.0.0-16.2.2** (L2) Verify that time sources for all logging components are
  synchronized, and that timestamps in security event metadata use UTC or
  include an explicit time zone offset. UTC is recommended to ensure consistency
  across distributed systems and to prevent confusion during daylight saving
  time transitions.
- **v5.0.0-16.2.3** (L2) Verify that the application only stores or broadcasts
  logs to the files and services that are documented in the log inventory.
- **v5.0.0-16.2.4** (L2) Verify that logs can be read and correlated by the log
  processor that is in use, preferably by using a common logging format.
- **v5.0.0-16.2.5** (L2) Verify that when logging sensitive data, the
  application enforces logging based on the data's protection level. For
  example, it may not be allowed to log certain data, such as credentials or
  payment details. Other data, such as session tokens, may only be logged by
  being hashed or masked, either in full or partially.

## V16.3 — Security Events

- **v5.0.0-16.3.1** (L2) Verify that all authentication operations are logged,
  including successful and unsuccessful attempts. Additional metadata, such as
  the type of authentication or factors used, should also be collected.
- **v5.0.0-16.3.2** (L2) Verify that failed authorization attempts are logged.
  For L3, this must include logging all authorization decisions, including
  logging when sensitive data is accessed (without logging the sensitive data
  itself).
- **v5.0.0-16.3.3** (L2) Verify that the application logs the security events
  that are defined in the documentation and also logs attempts to bypass the
  security controls, such as input validation, business logic, and
  anti-automation.
- **v5.0.0-16.3.4** (L2) Verify that the application logs unexpected errors and
  security control failures such as backend TLS failures.

## V16.4 — Log Protection

- **v5.0.0-16.4.1** (L2) Verify that all logging components appropriately encode
  data to prevent log injection.
- **v5.0.0-16.4.2** (L2) Verify that logs are protected from unauthorized access
  and cannot be modified.
- **v5.0.0-16.4.3** (L2) Verify that logs are securely transmitted to a
  logically separate system for analysis, detection, alerting, and escalation.
  The aim is to ensure that if the application is breached, the logs are not
  compromised.

## V16.5 — Error Handling

- **v5.0.0-16.5.1** (L2) Verify that a generic message is returned to the
  consumer when an unexpected or security-sensitive error occurs, ensuring no
  exposure of sensitive internal system data such as stack traces, queries,
  secret keys, and tokens.
- **v5.0.0-16.5.2** (L2) Verify that the application continues to operate
  securely when external resource access fails, for example, by using patterns
  such as circuit breakers or graceful degradation.
- **v5.0.0-16.5.3** (L2) Verify that the application fails gracefully and
  securely, including when an exception occurs, preventing fail-open conditions
  such as processing a transaction despite errors resulting from validation
  logic.
- **v5.0.0-16.5.4** (L3) Verify that a "last resort" error handler is defined
  which will catch all unhandled exceptions. This is both to avoid losing error
  details that must go to log files and to ensure that an error does not take
  down the entire application process, leading to a loss of availability.
